**Intelligent Motion Detector with Doppler Radar and
AI Analysis**

**1. Introduction & Motivation**

**The proposed project is an intelligent motion detector designed to
differentiate significant motion (such as a potential intruder) from
minor, non-threatening movements (like a pet moving within a confined
space). Using a Doppler radar sensor module, the device will detect
motion based on frequency shifts and apply AI-driven analysis to decide
whether to trigger an alarm or ignore the detected motion. This approach
aims to minimize false alarms and improve overall security
responsiveness.**

**2. Project Objectives**

- **Accurate Motion Detection: Utilize a Doppler radar sensor (e.g.,
  RCWL-0516) to detect motion and measure parameters such as speed and
  distance.**

- **Intelligent Decision Making: Implement an AI model to classify
  detected motion into significant (potential intruder) or insignificant
  (e.g., small pet) events.**

- **User-Friendly Interface: Provide audible alarms for significant
  detections and non-intrusive notifications for minor movements.**

- **Modular & Scalable Design: Develop a system that can be extended
  with additional sensors or enhanced algorithms in future iterations.**

**3. Design Specifications**

- **Sensor Module:**

  - **Component: Doppler radar sensor module.**

  - **Function: Detects movement through frequency shift (Doppler
    effect) and provides raw motion data.**

  - **Operating Range: Optimized for detecting motion over distances
    exceeding 1 meter.**

- **Signal Processing & AI Module:**

  - **Signal Thresholds: Set thresholds to filter out insignificant
    movement (e.g., movements less than 1 meter or below a defined speed
    threshold).**

  - **AI Classification:**

    - **Algorithm: Lightweight AI model (using frameworks such as
      TensorFlow Lite or TinyML) trained on labeled data to distinguish
      between human-sized objects and smaller entities.**

    - **Data: Model training will utilize sample motion data
      representing both significant intruder movements and common false
      triggers (like pets).**

  - **Processing Unit: Microcontroller (ESP32 recommended) to handle
    signal acquisition, data processing, and AI inference in real
    time.**

- **Alarm System:**

  - **Alerts: Triggers an audible alarm upon detecting a significant
    motion which is identified as an intruder by the AI model.**

- **Power & Enclosure:**

  - **Power Supply: Options include battery power for portability or USB
    power for stationary applications.**

  - **Enclosure: A compact, durable case designed for indoor use, with
    proper mounting provisions.**

**4. Conclusion**

**This project presents an innovative approach to motion detection by
combining Doppler radar technology with AI-driven analysis. It addresses
common pitfalls in motion detection systems, such as false alarms due to
insignificant movements, and provides a scalable solution for enhanced
security. Your approval will allow further development and testing of
this integrated system, ultimately contributing to improved embedded
systems design in practical security applications.**
